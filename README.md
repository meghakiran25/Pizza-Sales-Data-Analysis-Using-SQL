**Pizza Sales Data Analysis using SQL**<br>

Welcome to my Pizza Sales Analysis  project!

**OBJECTIVE**

The primary objective of this project is to leverage SQL for in-depth analysis of pizza sales data to  understand sales trends, customer preferences, and operational efficiency to enhance business performance.

**DATA**

The dataset  used in this analysis includes:

1. pizzas.csv: Information about different types of pizzas

2. pizza_types.csv: Provides details about pizza categories and name.

3. orders.csv: Details of each order placed

4. order_details.csv:  Specific details about each order, such as the quantity and type of pizza ordered.

**INSIGHTS**

1. High Order Volume and Revenue: With a substantial total number of orders placed and significant revenue generated, the business demonstrates a strong market presence and customer demand for our pizzas.

2. Popular Pizzas and Sizes: Identifying the most ordered pizza types and preferred sizes helps us understand customer preferences better, allowing us to optimize our menu and inventory accordingly.

3. Peak Ordering Times: The distribution of orders by hour highlights peak times, which can guide staffing and resource allocation to ensure efficient service during busy periods.

4. Revenue Drivers: Understanding which pizzas contribute the most to our revenue enables us to focus on promoting and enhancing these high-performing items.

5. Category Insights: The analysis of pizza categories and their respective performance aids in refining our product offerings and marketing strategies to better cater to customer demands.

6. Daily Sales Trends: Monitoring the average number of pizzas ordered per day and cumulative revenue over time provides a clear picture of our sales trends and business growth, helping in forecasting and planning.

**CONCLUSION**

By leveraging these insights, we can make informed decisions to improve our operational efficiency, enhance customer satisfaction, and drive business growth. Continuous monitoring and analysis of sales data using SQL will enable us to stay agile and responsive to market changes, ensuring sustained success in the competitive pizza industry.
